Approach Summary
-----------
Exygy has developed a prototype for the California Health and Human Services Agency in response to the ADPQ Vendor Pool Submission.

The prototype has been executed using Exygy’s proven Scrum Methodology, which fosters an iterative approach to product development. The developed product is a result of a few sprint iterations, and may be continually built upon for further improvement. See more details about the prototype schedule [here](https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/01.-Project-Management#schedule).

Exygy engaged their staff from multiple disciplinaries and organized them into three primary teams: Product, Design and Engineering. See more details about the prototype staff [here](https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/01.-Project-Management#team-organization).

The Product team was responsible for owning the backlog of requirements, working with the Design team to clearly define the epics based on the research process, and working with the Engineering team to implement the prioritized user stories. The team included a Product Owner (Eric Lam), who took ownership of the definition and prioritization of the product features. Eric also served as the prototype lead in charge of delivering a quality shippable product. See more details about the product management process and artifacts [here](https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/02.-Product-Management).

The Design team was responsible for employing their human-centered design techniques, which include conducting needs-finding research, persona development, lean UX, and usability tests to translate the product epics into product designs.  The team included a Design Lead, who served as the Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester (Sheba Najmi), and a Visual Designer (Mari Toledo). See more details about the design techniques, usability tests and artifacts [here](https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/03.-Design).

The Engineering team conducted sprint iterations to convert the detailed user stories, as defined by the Product and Design teams, into working and tested software. The team included a Scrum Master (Dave Kaplan), Technical Architect (Dave Kaplan), DevOps Engineer (Pierre Hanault), Backend Web Developer (Matt Luedke), Front End Web Developer (Jesse James). See more details about the technology choices, integration process, and deployment [here](https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/04.-Engineering).

The teams began the project with a Sprint 0 iteration which focused on setting up the tools, environments, reporting, and meeting ceremonies. The Product team used this time to document the epics into the product backlog and prioritize the work to define a high-level roadmap. During this time, the Design team performed preliminary discovery activities including subject research, comparative analysis, and persona definition.  The Engineering team setup their work environments and held initial technical architecture sessions to plan for the product design.

Following Sprint 0, the Design team began their active sprints which include conducting detailed user research, lean UX, and visual design for the priority Epics. The designs were iterated upon based on the user testing we held with foster parents and representatives of foster family agencies. The outcome of the sprints were validated wireframes, visual designs and enhanced pattern libraries to be used by the Engineering team.

After one Design sprint, the Engineering team began their active sprints of user story implementation. Sprint Planning meetings were held for the Product Owner and Design team representative to explain the prioritized user stories for the upcoming sprint. During each sprint, the Engineering team collaborated on the development, peer review, and QA testing of each story. Once stories were marked as ready for acceptance, the Product Owner reviewed the story for formal acceptance.

Throughout the Design and Engineering sprints, the Product team constantly groomed the backlog by refining and prioritizing the user stories based on feedback from the user testing and the implementation velocity. The Product team was also responsible for accepting stories and ensuring the shippable product meets the needs of the prompt.

Over the course of the prototype, we tracked the scrum team and product development progress by using these key metrics and reports. For scrum team reporting, we used Pivotal Tracker to generate the Sprint Reports and Sprint-Over-Sprint Reports, which measures the scrum team’s productivity for retrospective analysis. The team also used Pivotal Tracker to generate the product development reports in the form of Epic Reports and Release Burnups, which informed the Product team on the implementation progress to help guide the roadmap planning. See more details about the specific metrics and reports [here] (https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/06.-Metrics-and-Reporting)

The team also used a number of collaboration tools in addition to Pivotal Tracker, which include InVision, Slack, Zoom and Google Drive. See more details on the tools used [here](https://github.com/Exygy/chhs-carefinder/wiki/01.-Project-Management#tools).
